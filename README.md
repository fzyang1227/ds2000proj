This is an analysis of player stats and creation of our own player win contribution stat

Steps:
1. run api_v5.py (wait until api_v5.py finishes, can take several minutes)
2. run graphs.py

You will end up with a bunch of pdfs of graphs and three new csv files (statistics.csv, team_stats(2018)v2.csv and Contribution_stats.csv)

requires:
- numpy
- pandas
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
